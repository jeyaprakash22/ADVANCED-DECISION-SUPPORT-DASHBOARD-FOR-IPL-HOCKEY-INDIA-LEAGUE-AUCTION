## Technology used
  * Flask: Web framework used for building the interactive dashboard.
  * Python: The core programming language used for implementing data analysis models, including PCA and Factor Analysis.
  * PCA & Factor Analysis: Applied to cluster players and uncover key patterns, enabling the identification of optimal player combinations.
## 2. Key Features
### (i). PCA & Factor Analysis
  * Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Used for dimensionality reduction, PCA helps identify the most significant factors contributing to player performance. By reducing the complexity of data, it makes it easier to visualize key attributes that influence player value.
  * Factor Analysis: Used to detect underlying relationships between multiple performance metrics, enabling the clustering of players with similar attributes, which can then be targeted strategically during the auction.
### (ii). Clustering for High-Value Player Combinations
The dashboard clusters players based on their statistical profiles, facilitating the identification of high-value combinations for different positions or strategies.
It allows the auction team to make informed decisions, focusing on combinations of players that maximize team potential.
### (iii). Strategic Decision-Making Support
By visualizing clusters of players and their key performance indicators, the dashboard provides actionable insights that aid in forming a well-rounded team during the auction.
Auction managers and analysts can make quicker, data-driven decisions rather than relying on subjective assessments alone.
### (iv). Real-Time Data Processing
The dashboard updates dynamically during the auction, reflecting changes in available player data and making it easier to track player value fluctuations.
It integrates with the live auction data, ensuring decisions are based on the most current information available.
## 3. Benefits
  * Enhanced Auction Strategy: The dashboard's data-driven insights help auction managers select players with high potential, improving the overall strategic approach to the auction.
  * Improved Player Selection: By focusing on value combinations rather than individual player metrics, the tool helps identify opportunities for building a competitive team.
  * Real-Time Decision-Making: Live data processing ensures decisions during the auction are made with the latest player and team performance data.
## 4. Conclusion
The Advanced Decision Support Dashboard for the Hockey India League Auction empowers auction managers with data-driven insights, improving the decision-making process and ensuring optimal player selections. By leveraging PCA and Factor Analysis for clustering, the dashboard optimizes the auction strategy, leading to more informed, high-value player picks.
